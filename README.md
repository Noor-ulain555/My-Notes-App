# My-Notes-App
The MVVM-based My Notes application uses a Room database with insert and delete functionality. 

# Description:
My Notes is a simple Android application developed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and powered by a Room database to store and manage notes efficiently. This project serves as a foundation for building note-taking apps with robust database operations.

# Key Features:

Utilizes the Room Persistence Library to handle local data storage, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete notes.

# Insert and Delete Functionality:
Provides user-friendly interfaces to add new notes and delete existing ones, maintaining a streamlined user experience.
